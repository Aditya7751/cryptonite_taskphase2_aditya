## Approach
To start off I downloaded the vuln.c file from  picoctf, and went through the program till I noticed this section of the code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f79aeebb-49ba-4147-9e3a-48ee83f5ed6f)
the `gets()` function is infamous for being a massive vulnerability due to its potential for allowing overflows, this coupled with the fact that the `vuln` function used
the strcpy function(also known for causing potential vulnerability entry points)

knowing these facts, and also that the challenge was named buffer overflow, I assumed that entering a string longer than 100 characters would overflow , so I just entered an
arbitarily long string

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:/mnt/c/Users/Aditya/Downloads# nc saturn.picoctf.net 49747
Input: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

## Approach
After connecting to the instance, I am met with these options

```bash
Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Gr%114d_Cheese
```

I knew the challenge involved format specifiers in someway or another , so I chose `Gr%114d_Cheese` (no other options look like format specifiers), after entering this I was prompted with another message from the terminal

```bash
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_74f6c0e7}
```
From these options I chose `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` because again format specifiers, ultimately this gives me the key, I think this works because all the `%s`
specifiers allow us to print stuff from the programs memory
