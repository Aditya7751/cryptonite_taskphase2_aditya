## Approach
To start off I downloaded the vuln.c file from  picoctf, and went through the program till I noticed this section of the code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f79aeebb-49ba-4147-9e3a-48ee83f5ed6f)
the `gets()` function is infamous for being a massive vulnerability due to its potential for allowing overflows, this coupled with the fact that the `vuln` function used
the strcpy function(also known for causing potential vulnerability entry points)

knowing these facts, and also that the challenge was named buffer overflow, I assumed that entering a string longer than 100 characters would overflow , so I just entered an
arbitarily long string

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:/mnt/c/Users/Aditya/Downloads# nc saturn.picoctf.net 49747
Input: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
