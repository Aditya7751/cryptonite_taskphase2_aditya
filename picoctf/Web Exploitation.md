# Cookies

**FLAG** - picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}

Owing to the name of the challenge, I first check the cookies!

![Alt text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7272a2bc-4be7-4123-8d54-f0e74e4138b2)

I notice that the cookie value is -1, I decide to tinker around with it, by changing it to 0 and refreshing

with some trial and error I figure out the maximum possible value of the cookie is 28, knowing that I write the following python script

```python
import requests
f=open("answer.txt","a")
for i in range(28):
    cookie="name="+str(i)
    request=requests.get("http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check",headers={"Cookie":cookie})
    f.write(request.text)[Uploading answer2.txtâ€¦]()

    
f.close()
```

this wrote all the html source code into a answer.txt file, that I later used `Ctrl+F` to find the flag from answer.txt

# Forbidden Paths
**FLAG** - picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}
## Approach
This challenge requires us to enter a path to find the file that could not be accessed using the relative path. 
to get around this I enter the path `../../../../flag.txt`, as the `..` operator is used to access parent directories

## Incorrect Tangents
not many, but I entered the relative path slightly incorrect the first 2 times
## Concepts Learnt
Path Handling

## Approach
This challenge wants us to retrieve the /etc/passwd file using an XXE injection

after interacting with the site, I found out that after interacting with the details site, a POST request is sent with xml stuff in it
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9c0a9a-c06c-4a0d-a789-ca1213269022)
so after some researching I found an ideal payload from this github repo https://github.com/payloadbox/xxe-injection-payload-list
and after modifying this POST request I send it to repeater

finally getting the flag in return
## Incorrect Tangents
- didnt add the &xxe; part which gave unwanted output
- initial payload didnt work because it was slightly off
## Lessons Learnt
- XXE Injection
- Using Burpsuite
