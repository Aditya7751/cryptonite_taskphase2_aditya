with some trial and error I figure out the maximum possible value of the cookie is 28, knowing that I write the following python script

```python
import requests
f=open("answer.txt","a")
for i in range(29):
    cookie="name="+str(i)
    request=requests.get("http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check",headers={"Cookie":cookie})
    f.write(request.text)
    
f.close()
```

this wrote all the html source code into a answer.txt file, that I later used `Ctrl+F` to find the flag from
